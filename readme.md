# DNA Sequence Analysis Web Tool

A simple and interactive web application for analyzing DNA sequences.  
This tool calculates essential molecular properties such as GC content, melting temperature (Tm), AT/GC ratio, and translates the DNA sequence into its corresponding amino acid sequence.

## Features

- Input DNA sequence and organism name.
- Calculate:
  - Sequence length
  - GC content (%)
  - Melting temperature (Tm)
  - AT/GC ratio
  - Translate DNA to amino acid sequence
- Display results on the webpage.
- Download analysis results as a text file.
- User-friendly and responsive design.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5 & CSS3 for structure and styling.
- JavaScript for sequence processing and interactivity.
